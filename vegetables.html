            <h4>carrots</h4>
            <p> The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6. Carrots are typically found in orange color, athough there are purple, black, red, white and yellow variants. All of these carrots are native to Europe and Southwest Asia. The origins of the plant are assumed to be from Persia and was origionally harvested for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly digested part of the carrot is the actual root of the carrot, although the stems and leaves of a carrot are also eaten. The united Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (commonly known as FAO) reports that there was about 40 million tons of carrots produced in the year of 2018. Carrots can be consumed both raw and cooked</p>

            <h4>cucumbers</h4>
            <p>Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called slicing cucumbers. These verients are produced on vines with large leaves.Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin. In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often being sold in plastic skin for protection.You can also pickle cucumbers. The pickling is usually done withbrine, sugar, vinegar, and other spices. Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called picklers, grow to about 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide. Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines. Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.
                Cultivated for at least 3,000 years, the cucumber originated from India.</p>

            <h4>onions</h4>
            <p>The onion is also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. The onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi which can cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs. An onion can typically grow 6-18 inches in height, and has been selectively bred for at least 7,000 years intrerestingly enough, Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life. </p>

            <h4>cabbage</h4>
            <p>A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2 lb). Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer. Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large. As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage wighed in at 138 pounds. Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases. Interestingly enough, cabbage was described as a table luxury in the Roman Empire. New variates were introduced from the Renaissance on, mostly by Germanic-speaking people. Savoy cabbage was developed in the 16th century. By the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was popularised as staple food in central, northern, and eastern Europe.</p>
