            <h4>Gold</h4>
            <p>Gold! a precious metal and worth a chunk if you get your hands on a raw ore. Its a chemical element with the symbol AU, which in latin is short aurum or liquer. Its atomic number is 79 and is one of the higher atomic number elements that can occur naturally. Although gold is mostly seen in jewelry, gold makes for good conductors in industrial work! In fact, gold's properties make it so that it is resistant to corrosion, making it even more valuable in places such as nuclear power plants where corosion is more likeley to happen. As of 2020, there is currently an estimated total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold found above ground now. Gold is the most malleable of all metals, and can be stretched to considerable lengths before it breaks. The california gold rush of 1848 sparked as James W. Marshall discovered it for the alleged first time there, bringing an upwards of 300,000 people to go to California in search of gold. A single gram of gold can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter. Although most metals appear as gray or white, gold is a slightly reddish yellow. There are diffent types of gold combinations as well, such as rose gold, which is gold infued with copper, fourteen karat gold copper, which may be used for making police and other badges, blue gold which is made by alloying gold with iron, and purple gold which is made by alloying with alluminum  </p>

            <h4>Silver</h4>
            <p>Silver is described as a soft, white, lustrous transition metal. Its atomic number is 47 and its symbol is Ag, which in latin is short for Argentum which means "shiny White" in English. To this day, silver exhibits the highest electrical contuctivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal which makes it extreemly valuable for industrial work and mirror making. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. As a form of currency, silver can be invested in the form of silver dollars. It can cost anywhere from 10-100 dollars to invest in a single silver dollar. Silver can also be used as jewelry in the form of necklasses, rings, bracelets and watches. In the famous James Bond films, you can often see the main character, James bond, rocking his silver watch to mach his classy tuxedo Besides being a form of jewelry and currency, silver can be found in everyday objects such as solar panels, water filtration units, and table utensils "hence the term silverware". Interestingly enough, one could dilute silver into silver nitrate and use it to work as a disinfectant that can be used for medical purposes when treating wounds as well as being made into the medical instruments themselves. Such medical instruments include all of the tools that dentists use to poke your teeth with as well as surgery tools. Silver can also be made into bullets and can cause more damage to a target. It is believed that a silver bullet can kill a werewolf, but that is to be determined.</p>

            <h4>Oxygen</h4>
            <p>Oxygen is what animals inhale and what plants exhale, and is the Chemical element with the symbol O and the atomic number of 8. Oxygen is a highly reactive nonmetal that can have devastating results when set ablaze. oxygen is Earth's most abbundant element, and is the third most abbundant element in the universe. Most of the mass in a living organism is oxygen in fact, 60% of the human body is oxygen. One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant. </p>

            <h4>copper</h4>
            <p>Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (meaning cuprum in latin) and is the 29th atomic element. Copper is soft, mallebale, and ductile aa well as high thermal and electrical conductivity. Copper is used as a cunductor for heat and electricity and is often used in the making of litning rods for houses as well as electrical wiring for all your electical needs. Copper is also used in a form of currency typically seen in pennies, although copper coins do exist. copper is often used as a decorative tool as well and is often paired with rare elements such as silver and gold to make beutiful jewelry peices and astonishing works of art. copper can also be found in art pigments used in paints for a more exotic touch. copper can be found in all animals as well, and it is stated that an adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 milligrams of copper per kilogram of body weight. Such are the reasons as to why some people say blood smells like copper or why it feels like you mouth is full of copper after a hard workout. Copper does not react to water the way other metals do. That being said, copper is known to oxidise and corrode when exposed to oxygen for an extended period of time. copper, when oxidised, turns from a bright orange-brown to a sort of teal greenish gray. This is why the stautue of liberty is seen as green as opposed to brownish red. To prevent copper from oxidising, one may apply wax to copper as the wax acts as a shield to the effects oxygen has on copper. It also makes the copper shiny, which is a bonus.</p>
