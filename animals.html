            <h4>African Lions</h4>
            <p> Lions are some of the largest cats that roam the Earth. In fact, they are the second largest cats as tigers are slightly larger. The male lion is known to grow thick maines that encircle their heads, while the females are typically slim and maineless. The African lion can be found in parts of Sahara Africa in graslands and open woodlands where they are better suited to hunt prey. African Lions live and hunt in packs known as prides that can consist of up to 40 lions in which most are females while only a couple are males. Unlike most species that roam the earth, it is the female lions that do the hunting while the males defend the pride's territory. African Lions are big game hunters and together they collaborate to take down medium sized or larger animals such as antelopes, zebras, wildebeest, and even baby elephants. An average African lion eats up to 8,000 to 9,000 calories per day. </p>

            <h4>Tigers</h4>
            <p>There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris sondaica). Being classified as the largest cats in the world, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. Tigers usually hunt alone and stalk prey. A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat a day. On average, tigers can breed up to two to four cubs every two years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months. Tigers typically gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age three or four for females and four or five years for males. However, juvenile mortality is high as about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild. Males of the larger subspecies known as the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds. For males of the smaller subspecies know as the Sunda tiger, the upper range is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males are larger in size than females. Tigers are mostly solitary, apart from associations between mother and cubs. Individual tigers have a large territory, and the size is determined mostly by the availability of prey. Individuals mark their domain with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing. Across their range, tigers face unrelenting pressures from poaching, retaliatory killings, and habitat loss. They are forced to compete for space with dense and often growing human populations.</p>

            <h4>Brown Bears</h4>
            <p>Brown bears Are omnivores that mostly eat fish and berries. Their favorite fish are salmon in which the brown bear stands in a river and waits for the salmon to come to them. This is usually done by waiting by the up cast of a river since salmon, unlike most fish, move upwards across a stream as opposed to downwards. When going up small waterfalls, the salmon tends to pop out like popcorn on the surface of the up cast. It is this opportunity that the brown bear uses to capture the fish as it is when the salmon are most vulnerable for an ambush, opening their gaping maw at the unsuspecting fish. The brown bear is no stranger to red meats as well and uses its big strong claws and powerful jaws to take down small mammals such as rabbits, squirrels, and even baby deer. Brown bears are also known to pick berries from time to time. These berries are mostly an assortment of blueberries, huckleberries, and buffalo berries. That being said, a brown bear will likely eat any berry it comes across. If the bear so chose, it could eat up to 30,000 berries a day to maintain a healthy fruit based diet. As far as hibernation goes, A brown bear eats at least 20,000 calories per day in preparation for hibernation. When it is finally time to hibernate, a brown bear hunkers down somewhere cozy and goes into a deep slumber that can last anywhere from five to eight months.</p>

            <h4>Wolves</h4>
            <p>Currently there are two types of wolves in existence right now, those being the grey and red wolves. Gray wolves, or timber wolves, are canines with long bushy tails that are often black-tipped. Their coat color is typically a mix of gray and brown with buffy facial markings and undersides, but the color can vary from solid white to brown or black. Gray wolves look somewhat like a large German shepherd. Red Wolves, on the other hand, are very endangered. In Fact, they are the most endangered member of the canine family to date. Red wolves are Native to the United States and have a intermediate sive between that of a gray wolf and a wild coyote. As of this day, the only place where you can find a red wolf in its natural habitat is in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina, and there are only 35 or fewer red wolves left in existence, which is why the International Union for the Conservation of Nature classifies them as critically endangered. Both species of wolf aew carnivorous and like to eat anything medium sized or smaller such as deer, small mammals such as rabbits and mice, and other small critters. A gray wolf can eat up to 14 pounds of meat each day while a red wolf typically eats up to five pounds of meat. Both are pack animals that live in groups of typically five to eight wolves. Both wolves communicate through body language, scent marking, barking, growling, and howling. Much of their communication is about reinforcing the social hierarchy of the pack. When a wolf wants to show that it is submissive to another wolf, it will crouch, whimper, tuck in its tail, lick the other wolf's mouth, or roll over on its back. </p>
